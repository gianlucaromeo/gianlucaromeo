## Hey - My name is Gianluca 🤝

I'm a software engineer, passionate about user-centric design.

> I believe in learning concepts more than frameworks and languages.

* 🎨 I can ideate user-centric UIs, and design them with **Figma**.

* 🚅 I can design performant frontends, and develop them with **React.js** (web) and **Flutter** (mobile).

* 🔙 I'm getting better at developing backends with **Django** (REST Framework) and **FastAPI**, but for something quick I go with **Firebase**. I also use **Next.js** and **tRPC**.

* 🦺 I safely store data in **MySQL**, **Postgres**, or **Firestore**.

* 😖 I'm learning more about **Docker**.

* 👴 I have past experience with C++, Java, Processing.
